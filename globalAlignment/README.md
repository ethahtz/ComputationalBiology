Readme file for align.py  
Author: Etha Hua

Purpose: Implementation of the global alignment algorithm
with a naive scoring function and a linear gap genalty.
M refers to score of matching,  
m refers to score of mismatching and,  
g refers to the uniform gap score.  

Usage: 

For default scoring scheme (M=4, m=-2, g=-2):
`python3 align.py < [inputFileName]`
e.g.: `python3 align.py < aligntest.input1`

For user-defined scoring scheme:
`python3 align.py [M] [n] [g] < [inputFileName]`
e.g.: `python3 align.py 6 2 -2 < aligntest.input1`
